- Influential environment variables '*_C_INCLUDE' and '*_C_LIB' are renamed to '*_CFLAGS' and '*_CLIBS' respectively. When set, the values of the variables override the values set with '--with-*-root', '--with-*-include', and '-with-*-lib'.
- The default subdirectory to be searched for libxml2 header files is switched from '$with_xml2_root/include' to 'XML2_ROOT/include/libxml2'.
- Automatic update of LD_LIBRARY_PATH when running the test suite on Linux (no need to specify rpath flags at configure-time anymore).
- cfortran.h is not used anymore and removed from the repository. The name-mangling scheme required to enable Fortran backend for LAPACK is detected at configure-time.
- The configure script generates a public header file 'yac_config.h' (installed to $prefix/include), which can be used by user applications to check for features enabled in YAC. The file can be safely included by Fortran compilers as well.
- Silent mode for 'make' is enabled by default (can be overridden at the configure time with the option '--disable-silent-rules' or at the build time with the argument V=1, e.g. 'make V=1')
- The configure script does not try to guess which libraries are required to enable MPI: users are encouraged to use MPI compiler wrappers).
