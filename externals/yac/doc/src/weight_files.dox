/**
 * \page weight_files Creating weight files and visualise them

\author Moritz Hanke (Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum Hamburg)

In order to let YAC write out weight files the writing has to be enabled
either through the interface or the \ref yaml_file "configuration file" by
providing a weight file name.

YAC will write out the wight file in parallel. This parallel output can be
configured as described here: \ref io_config_detail

\code{.yaml}

coupling:
  - src_component: ...
    tgt_component: ...
    ...
    field: TAUX
    weight_file_name: *weights_TAUX.nc*
  - ...

\endcode

The my_weight_file.nc can be converted to vtk using weights2vtk.x in the contrib directory

\code{.sh}

weights2vtk.x -S I -T I -s <source_grid.nc> -t <target_grid.nc> -w my_weight_file.nc -o weights.vtk

\endcode

weights.vtk can be visualised with paraview.
